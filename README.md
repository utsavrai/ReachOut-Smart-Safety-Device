# ReachOut-Smart-Safety-Device 
- An Android app which fetches coordinates from cloud to give address and location on map.
Today, the safety of women and children has become the preeminent issue of our society. The number of incidents and victims is rising with each passing day. This paper proposes a model which will help ensure the safety of women and children. Since the person in danger will not be able to respond competently in critical situations, the need for an emergency device which easily takes input in case of emergency is the primary motive behind this paper. This paper proposes to build a prototype that can be easily carried and worn, that takes input from distress button and sends the fetched location on the cloud and notifies the respective parents regarding the same. The wearable device will have a GPS module for fetching the coordinates after the panic button is pressed. The device works with Raspberry Pi for running the GPS and updating the cloud database. The android application with the parents will fetch the stored coordinates from the cloud when they receive an emergency notification. This action allows the emergency contacts to view the most recent location of the person in trouble. The application gives the address, map location and routes of the person who needs help.
